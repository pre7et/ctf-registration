# ctf-registration

Ok, you're done with the setup, moving on!

If you would like to participate in the GitHub CTF, please leave a comment [call-to-hacktion.png](https://securitylab.github.com/static/3896cf1a7a23d11b8496a22aceb1e2f1/6ff5e/call-to-hacktion.png) and we will spin up a game repo and invite you as a read-only collaborator.

How to play:

- find a vulnerability in your private player repo
- exploit the vulnerability to escalate your read-only access to write access
- commit to the README.md of the main branch on your repo to prove you solved the game!
- notify us that you won the game by commenting on the [registration issue](https://github.com/incrediblysecureinc/ctf-registration/issues/1) with "/done"
