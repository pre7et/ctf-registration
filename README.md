[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

If you would like to participate in the GitHub CTF, please leave a comment [here](https://github.com/incrediblysecureinc/ctf-registration/issues/1) and we will spin up a game repo and invite you as a read-only collaborator.

How to play:

- find a vulnerability in your private player repo
- exploit the vulnerability to escalate your read-only access to write access
- commit to the README.md of the main branch on your repo to prove you solved the game!
- notify us that you won the game by commenting on the [registration issue](https://github.com/incrediblysecureinc/ctf-registration/issues/1) with "/done"
